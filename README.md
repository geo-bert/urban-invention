# Urban Invention

This website/game was created as part of my final project for the university course "Discipline and Punish? BDSM, Power and Society" at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. It was created with the React framework.

In the game you regain your memory of an out of the ordinary party experience via solving puzzles that result in images, reminding you of the events that transpired.

The game consists of six chapters with each but the last ending with a [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). If you get stuck you can reset the board, or if the puzzle is too frustrating, time consuming or hard you can skip it without a penalty.

The game should be enjoyed on a PC or Laptop and was tested using Chromium based browsers.

## Intent

This part contains spoilers for the story of the game!

This game is intended for a more casual audience, that has not yet had any prior experience with the topics surrounding BDSM. I attempt to convey some risks involved when practicing certain parts of BDSM whilst not deterring the player from it all together.

The aim was to purposely not include any hints towards the gender of the played character to enable the possibility of the player projecting themself onto it.

I tried to use the scrambled puzzles as a metaphor for the mind that is in disarray. The text moves in a wavy pattern to signify that the entire story transpires in the mind of the protagonist.

There is no intent behind the name of the game. It was just the name Github suggested when creating the repository. I could not and still can't think of a proper name.
