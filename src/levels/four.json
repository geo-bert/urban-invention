        "After all the explanations I was invited for a drink.",
        "There was a bar with a barkeeper. It was nothing too fancy but still had its charme.",
        "The barkeep suggested a \"house special\" drink and asked me whether I had any allergies.",
        "I saw him shake up the drink right before my eyes.",
        "He had real talent and seemed to be a professional.",
        "After finishing, he gave me the drink and I tried it.",
        "It had an interesting fruity flavour, but it seemed to me that it was missing something.",
        "My drinking experience was suddenly interupted when the friend that invited me came over to greet me.",
        "After finishing with the formalities, I turned back around to take another sip of the beverage.",
        "When I swallowed, it somehow tasted differently but at first I thought nothing of it.",
        "But then my friend told me, that someone put something in my drink.",
        "I started to panic, and started to loose consciousness...",
        "That must have been it! I was poisoned. Oh no.",
        "...",
        "No, no, no. I it can't have been.",
        "I remember the bartender apologizing, because he forgot to include the most important ingredient.",
        "He explained, he added it when I wasn't looking to cover up his mistake.",
        "Puh... But if this wasn't it, what else could have happened to me..."
