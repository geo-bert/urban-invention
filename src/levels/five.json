        "Moments after finishing my drink, the crash course continued.",
        "This time I was questioned whether I wanted to continue because the props are getting more intense.",
        "I thought to myself: Yeah sure, why not and agreed.",
        "They lead me to a basement that looked like it could be a torture chamber from the medieval age.",
        "The walls were bare white bricks, the floor was concrete with a few water puddles and there were apparatus that looked rather intimidating.",
        "One device that stood out to me was a wooden wedge triangle on legs called a Spanish horse.",
        "They told me it was used to torture woman during some American war and that weights are used to increase the pain.",
        "But they also assured me that all the devices were modified such that they can safely be used for pleasure.",
        "They threw around so many terms and definitions my head started to spin.",
        "On a completely unrelated note:",

        "After questioning one of the hosts why that is, I got the reply that the party had not even begun and I was a little early.",
        "But this had proven to be advantageous because I could be introduced to the topic without any interference.",
        "Nonetheless, all the explaining has nothing to do with my situation right now.",
        "There has to be something else I am forgetting..."
