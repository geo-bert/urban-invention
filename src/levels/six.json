        "I got guided to a small chamber on the ground level.",
        "From the outside it looked very small with only a bed and nothing else.",
        "The host asked me if I wanted to try the \"mysterious pleasure chamber\", his words not mine, out.",
        "To me it looked like fun and I wanted to find out what the fuzz was about.",
        "He let me inside and closed the door behind me.",
        "At first nothing happened and it was rather dull.",
        "I could not make sense of the purpose of this room. I only heard a quiet hissing noise.",
        "After a few minutes I started to get lightheaded and started to have difficulties breathing.",
        "Before I had time to realise what was happening, I passed out.",
        "Now that my eyes have adapted to darkness, I can see why.",
        "There are canisters with what looks like Nitrogen inside.",
        "It seems like I was supposed to derive pleasure from the asphyxiation.",
        "I need to get out of here ASAP.",
        "If only I could move my limbs...",
        "With all my might I am able to let out a squirmish scream.",
        "Oh no... I am dizzy again. At least I see a light.",
        "\"Are you ok?\"",
        "Before I can answer I once again lose consciousness."
